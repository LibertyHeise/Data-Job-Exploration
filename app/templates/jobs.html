                      field that uses elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application-specific
                      knowledge to gather, make, and communicate principled conclusions from data. Data science is
                      present in every aspect of the mission. NSA Data Scientists tackle challenging real-world problems
                      leveraging big data, high-performance computing, machine learning, and a breadth of other
                      methodologies. We are looking for critical thinkers, problem solvers, and motivated individuals
                      who are enthusiastic about data and believe that answers to hard questions lie in the
                      yet-to-be-told story of diverse, complicated data sets. You will employ your mathematical science,
                      computer science, and quantitative analysis skills to develop solutions to complex data problems
                      and take full advantage of NSA's capabilities to tackle the highest priority foreign intelligence
                      and cybersecurity challenges. As a Data Scientist, your responsibilities may include: -
                      Exploratory data analysis and exploratory model-fitting to reveal data features of interest -
                      Machine-learned predictive modeling - Construct usable data sets from multiple sources to meet
                      customer needs - Identifying and analyzing anomalous data (including metadata) - Developing
                      conceptual design and models to address mission requirements - Developing qualitative and
                      quantitative methods for characterizing datasets in various states. - Performing analytic

                      directly supporting a technical mission office or into the Data Science Development Program
                      (DSDP). For the former, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with NSA's experts in the
                      field of data science and other computational disciplines while tackling NSA's highest priority
                      mission challenges. You will have opportunities to attend technical conferences with experts
                      internally and from industry and academia as well as discuss and share NSA's challenges and
                      successes at technical roundtables. The Data Science Development Program (DSDP) is a three-year
                      opportunity to develop and enhance your data science skills. Participants experience the breadth
                      of data science at NSA through six- to nine-month assignments in a variety of diverse
                      organizations, and collaborate with NSA's experts in the field of data science. You will have
                      opportunities to attend technical conferences with experts from industry and academia, and you
                      will routinely discuss and share NSA's challenges and successes at weekly technical roundtables.
                      You will study data science and related subjects taught by NSA experts. We foster an environment
                      where you will develop your data science skills, while quickly contributing to NSA's highest
                      priority mission challenges. Graduates of the DSDP may choose their first permanent assignments
                      from any of the NSA Directorates. Qualifications The qualifications listed are the minimum
                      acceptable to be considered for the position. Applicants who meet minimum qualifications may be
                      asked to complete the Data Science Examination (DSE) evaluating their knowledge of statistics,
                      mathematics, and computer science topics that pertain to data science work. Passing this

                      Us: At Cipher Tech Solutions, Inc. (Cipher Tech), we take great pride in supporting some of the
                      most mission critical work in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The
                      majority of our company is comprised of extremely talented software developers who write
                      production tools which directly support one of two missions: digital forensics and malware reverse
                      engineering. Digital forensics is the practice of extracting and processing evidence from
                      computers, phones, tablets, cameras, flash-drives, and just about any other form of digital media.
                      The results of our work are then used to support federal and military law enforcement, counter
                      intelligence, and counter terrorist activities. Malware reverse engineering is the practice of
                      analyzing extremely advanced malicious code. The goal of a reverse engineer is to understand how
                      the malicious code works and determine facts such as: How did it infect the victim's computer What
                      kind of information it is seeking to steal How is it communicating with the author (actor) Who
                      that actor might be. Important: Be aware that you are applying for a job that requires a U.S.
                      Government Security Clearance. The U.S. government will not issue security clearances to recent

                      in any illegal drug use within the past twelve months (illegal drug use includes, but is not

                      over-the-counter substances, and the use of medical or recreational marijuana that may be deemed
                      legal at the state level but is still considered illegal by the federal government). NOTE: CIPHER
